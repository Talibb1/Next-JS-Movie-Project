## About
This website is built using Next.js 13 and use TMDB API to fetch movie and TV serial data.

To get started, you will need to obtain an API key from TMDB by creating an account on their website (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable.

    ```
5. Run the development server
